## Goal

To set up a small infrastructure in AWS ready to host a theoretical application. This infrastructure should be created using Terraform. There should be sufficient documentation at the end of the challenge so that someone who is unfamiliar with the challenge will be able to re-launch the infrastructure with minimal issues. 

Please see the the PDF document sent by email for the detailed requirements. The candidate is expected to follow all the requirements. In case they think there is a strong reason to make changes to them, they are expected to describe and explain their choice in the documentation. 

Please make sure the size of the instances for the Compute and RDS setup is not bigger than necessary.
